# MurmurX
Built a fully local, voice-driven AI pipeline covering audio capture, speech-to-text, LLM inference, and text-to-speech. Uses Whisper.cpp for offline transcription and Qwen-2.5 ~3B for on-device reasoning, with modular Python components optimized for privacy, cost, and zero cloud dependencies.
